 This program was created to mimic a basic game of space invaders. The main technology used was a library called p5.js. This library makes it a lot easier to create games within javascript. I used a canvas to create the game and a series of conditions to conduct the game play. I used the skeleton framework to make css a lot easier. I created my own css file (game.css) to override the certain properties I didn't like.

I first created the server along with ejs files and made sure that all seven RESTful routes worked. After that I created a javascript file and worked on game logic. After finishing the game, I linked the server to the javascript files.

I would like to: 
    Be able to have the new score route be on the actual play.ejs file.
    Include a function to change the color of the ship.
    Include sound affects as well as some music.
    Have an login so that only admins can delete scores.
    Make it so scores are automatically saved when editing so they can't be changed.
    Have mutiple types of aliens.
